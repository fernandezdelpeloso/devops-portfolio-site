# Terraform AWS Multi-Tier Infrastructure

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to deploy a multi-tier architecture on AWS using **Terraform**. The architecture consists of a public load balancer, web tier in public subnets, and a private data tier using RDS in private subnets.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Terraform** (v1.5+)
- **AWS EC2**, **RDS**, **VPC**, **ALB**, **Security Groups**
- **CloudWatch Logs** for monitoring

## 📁 Repository
- GitHub: [aws-multitier-terraform](https://github.com/fernandezdelpeloso/aws-multitier-terraform)

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Details
- VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets
- Internet Gateway for public access
- NAT Gateway for private subnet egress
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Auto-scaling EC2 Web Tier
- RDS (PostgreSQL) in private subnets
- Bastion Host (optional)

## 🚀 Deploy Instructions
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fernandezdelpeloso/aws-multitier-terraform.git
cd aws-multitier-terraform
```
2. Set up AWS credentials
3. Initialize and apply Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## 📊 Example Outputs
- Public ALB DNS Name: `http://multi-tier-app-12345678.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
- RDS Endpoint: `multi-tier-db.c8d2rjsxyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Importance of modular Terraform structure for reuse
- Managing outputs and remote state
- Real-world challenges with NAT Gateway costs and subnet CIDR planning

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- Separate security groups per tier
- Least privilege IAM roles for EC2 and Terraform
- Optional Bastion host access via SSH (restricted IPs only)

## ✅ Next Steps
- Add monitoring with CloudWatch and custom alarms
- Integrate CI/CD for auto-deploying updates
- Add HTTPS termination at ALB
